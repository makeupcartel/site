## Convert CardOnFile (Payment Method)

The client needed a payment method that allows reps to create orders without using the card details.
The customer card details are on NetSuite. The rep created the order and pushes it to NetSuite.
In NetSuite they will assign it to the correct rep and card.

* Customer Comment: 
```
A high performing stockists SMSs rep to put through an order for 10 products.
Rep puts in through Magento under stockist account but can't take payment in Magento since the rep doesn't know the cc details. Chooses 'CC on file' payment method.                
The order comes through to NetSuite, rep takes payment with a credit card saved in their account
